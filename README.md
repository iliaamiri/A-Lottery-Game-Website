Lottery website. You buy as many tickets as you want. Then at a specific date and time of the game, the game will randomly select a ticket. If it was you, you'll win up to the total value of tickets everyone bought in that game.

2. Go to `/witcher/app/config/database.php` and config your database (it has to be MySQL).
3. Go to `witcher/app/config/server.php` and config your server information.
4. Oh I forgot I haven't upload the database.
